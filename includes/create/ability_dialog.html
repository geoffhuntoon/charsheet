          <h2>General Information</h2>
          <paper-dialog-scrollable dialog-element="ability-dialog">
            <p>Just about every die roll you make is going to be modified based on your character's abilities. A tough
              character has a better chance of surviving a wyvern's poison sting. A perceptive character is more likely
              to notice bugbears sneaking up from behind. A stupid character is not as likely to find a secret door that
              leads to hidden treasure chamber. YOur ability scores tell you what your modifiers are for rolls such as
              these.
            </p>
            <p>Your character has six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
              Each of your character's above-average abilities gives you a benefit on certain die rolls, and each
              below-average ability gives you a disadvantage on other die rolls. When creating your character, you roll
              your scores randomly, assign them to the abilities as you like, and raise and lower them according to the
              character's race. Later, you can increase them as your character advances in experience.
            </p>
          </paper-dialog-scrollable>
        </div>

        <div class="ability-scores">
          <h2>Ability Scores</h2>
          <paper-dialog-scrollable dialog-element="ability-dialog">
            <p>To create an ability score for your character, roll four six-sided dice (4d6). Disregard the lowest die
              roll and total the three highest ones. The result is a number between 3 (horrible) and 18 (tremendous).
              The average ability score for a typical commoner is 10 or 11, but your character is not typical. The most
              common ability scores for player characters (PCs) are 12 and 13. (That's right, the average player
              character is above average.)
            </p>
            <p>Make this roll six times, recording each result. Once you have six scores, assign each score to one of
              the six abilities. At this step, you need to know what kind of person your character is going to be,
              including his or her race and class, in order to know how best to distribute the ability scores. Choosing
              a race other than human or half-elf causes some of these ability scores to change.
            </p>
            <h2>Ability Modifiers</h2>
            <p>Each ability, after changes made because of race, has a modifier ranging from -5 to +5. The table on the
              next tab shows the modifier for each score. It also shows bonus spells, which you'll need to know about if
              your character is a spellcaster.
            </p>
            <p>The modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your character tries to do something related to
              that ability. For instance, you apply your character's Strength modifier to your roll when he or she tries
              to hit something with a sword. YOu also use the modifier with some numbers that aren't die rolls - for
              example, you apply your character's Dexterity modifier to his or her Armor Class (AC). A positive modifier
              is called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty.
            </p>
            <h2>Abilities and Spellcasters</h2>
            <p>The ability that governs bonus spells depends on what type of spellcaster your character is: Intelligence
              for wizards; Wisdom for clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers; or Charisma for sorcerers and bards. In
              addition to having a high ability score, a spellcaster must be of high enough class level to be able to
              cast spells of a given spell level. For instance, the wizard Mialee has an Intelligence score of 15, so
              she's smart enough to get one bonus 1st-level spell and one bonus 2nd-level spell. (She will not actually
              get the bonus 2nd-level spell until she is a 3rd-level wizard, since that's the minimum level a wizard
              must be to cast 2nd-level spells.)
            </p>
            <p>If your character's ability score is 9 or lower, you can't cast spells tied to that ability. For example,
              if Mialee's Intelligence score dropped to 9 because of a poison that reduces intellect, she would not be
              able to cast even her simplest spells until cured.
            </p>
            <h2>Rerolling</h2>
            <p>If your scores are too low, you may scrap them and roll all six scores again. Your scores are considered
              too low if the sum of your modifiers (before adjustments because of race) is 0 or lower, or if your
              highest score is 13 or lower.

          <paper-dialog-scrollable dialog-element="ability-dialog">
            <p>Strength measures your character's muscle and physical power. This ability is especially important for
              fighters, barbarians, rangers, and monks because it helps them prevail in combat. Strength also limits the
              amount of equipment your character can carry. You apply your character's Strength modifier to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Melee attack rolls.</li>
              <li>Damage rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown weapon (including a sling). (<i>Exceptions:</i>
                Off-hand attacks receive only one-half the character's Strength bonus, while two-handed attacks receive
                one and a half times the Strength bonus. A Strength penalty, but not a bonus, applies to attacks made
                with a bow that is not a composite bow.)

            <p>Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition. While Intelligence
              represents one's ability to analyze information, Wisdom represents being in tune with and aware of one's
              surroundings. An "absentminded professor" has low Wisdom and high Intelligence. A simpleton (low
              Intelligence) might still have great insight (high Wisdom). Wisdom is the most important ability for
              clerics and druids, and it is also important for paladins and rangers. If you want your character to have
              acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every creature has a Wisdom score. You apply your character's
              Wisdom modifier to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Will saving throws (for negating the effect of charm person and other spells).</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers get bonus spells based on their Wisdom scores. The minimum Wisdom
              score needed to cast a cleric, druid, paladin, or ranger spell is 10 + the spell's level.

          <h2>Charisma</h2>
          <paper-dialog-scrollable dialog-element="ability-dialog">
            <p>Charisma measures a character's force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, ability to
              lead, and physical attractiveness. This ability represents actual strength of personality, not merely how
              one is perceived by others in a social setting. Charisma is most important for paladins, sorcerers, and
              bards. It is also important for clerics, since it affects their ability to turn undead. Every creature has
              a Charisma score. You apply your character's Charisma modifier to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Gather Information, Handle Animal, Intimidate, Perform, and Use Magic
                Device checks. These are the skills that have Charisma as their key ability.
              </li>
              <li>Checks that represent attempts to influence others.</li>
              <li>Turning checks for clerics and paladins attempting to turn zombies, vampires, and other undead.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sorcerers and bards get bonus spells based on their Charisma scores. The minimum Charisma score needed to
              cast a sorcerer or bard spell is 10 + the spell's level.

          <h2>Example of Generating and Assigning Ability Scores</h2>
          <paper-dialog-scrollable dialog-element="ability-dialog">
            <p>Monte wants to create a new character. He rolls four six-sided dice (4d6) and gets 5, 4, 4, and 1.
              Ignoring the lowest roll, he records the result: 13. He rolls the dice five more times and gets these six
              scores: 13, 10, 15, 12, 8, and 14. Monte decides to play a strong, tough dwarf fighter. Now he assigns his
              scores to abilities.
            </p>
            <p>Strength gets the highest score, 15. His character has a +2 Strength bonus that will serve him well in
              combat.
            </p>
            <p>Constitution gets the next highest score, 14. The dwarf's +2 racial bonus to Constitution improves his
              Constitution score to 16, which gives him a +3 modifier. This bonus gives the character more hit points
              and better Fortitude saving throws.
            </p>
            <p>Monte puts his lowest score, 8, into Charisma. The dwarf's -2 racial penalty to Charisma reduces his
              Charisma score to 6, for a -2 penalty.
            </p>
            <p>Monte has two bonus-range scores left (13 and 12), plus an average score (10). Dexterity gets the 13 (+1
              bonus), which helps with ranged weapon attacks and with Reflex saving throws. (Monte's also thinking
              ahead. A Dexterity score of 13 qualifies his character for the Dodge feat.)
            </p>
            <p>Wisdom gets the 12 (+1 bonus). The Wisdom bonus helps with perception skills, such as Spot and Listen, as
              well as with Will saving throws.
            </p>
            <p>Intelligence gets the 10 (no bonus or penalty). An average Intelligence isn't bad for a fighter.</p>

        <div class="changing-scores">
          <h2>Changing Ability Scores</h2>
          <paper-dialog-scrollable dialog-element="ability-dialog">
            <p>Over time, the ability scores your character starts with can change. Ability scores can increase with no
              limit. Points at which ability changes occur include the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Add 1 point to any score upon attaining 4th level and at every fourth level your character attains
                thereafter (8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level).
              </li>
              <li>Many spells and magical effects temporarily increase or decrease ability scores. The <i>ray of
                enfeeblement</i> spell reduces a creature's Strength, and the <i>bull's strength</i> spell increases it.
                Sometimes a spell hampers a character, reducing his or her ability score. A character trapped by an
                <i>entangle</i> spell, for example, acts as if his or her Dexterity were 4 points lower than it really
                is.
              </li>
              <li>Several magic items improve ability scores as long as the character is using them. For example,
                <i>gloves of Dexterity</i> improve the wearer's Dexterity score. (Magic items are described in the
                <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>.) Note that a magic item of this type can't change an ability score by
                more than +6.
              </li>
              <li>Some rare magic items can boost an ability score permanently, as can a <i>wish</i> spell. Such an
                increase is called an inherent bonus. An ability score can't have an inherent bonus of more than +5.
              </li>
              <li>Poisons, diseases, and other effects can temporarily harm an ability (ability damage). Ability points
                lost to damage return on their own at a rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.
              </li>
              <li>Some effects drain abilities, resulting in a permanent loss (ability drain). Points lost this way
                don't return on their own, but they can be regained with spells, such as <i>restoration</i>.
              </li>
              <li>As a character ages, some ability scores go up and others go down.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When an ability score changes, all attributes associated with that score change accordingly. For example,
              when Mialee becomes a 4th-level wizard, she decides to increase her Intelligence score to 16. That score
              gives her a 3rd-level bonus spell (which she'll pick up upon attaining 5th level, when she becomes able to
              cast 3rd-level spells), and it also increases the number of skill points she gets per level from 4 to 5 (2
              per level for her class, plus another 3 per level from her Intelligence bonus). As a new 4th-level
              character, she can get the skill points immediately  after raising her Intelligence, so she'll get 5
              points for attaining 4th level in the wizard class. She does not retroactively get additional points for
              her previous levels (that is, skill points she would have gained if she had had an Intelligence score of
              16 starting at 1st level).

          <h2>Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma</h2>
          <paper-dialog-scrollable dialog-element="ability-dialog">
            <p>You can use your character's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores to guide you in roleplaying your
              character. Here is some background (just guidelines) about what these scores can mean.
            </p>
            <p>A smart character (one with high Intelligence) is curious, knowledgeable, and prone to using big words. A
              character with a high Intelligence but low Wisdom may be smart but absentminded, or knowledgeable but
              lacking in common sense. A character with high Intelligence but low Charisma may be a know-it-all or a
              reclusive scholar. A smart character lacking in both Wisdom and Charisma may put her foot in her mouth
              often.
            </p>
            <p>A character with low Intelligence mispronounces and misuses words, has trouble following directions, or
              fails to get the joke.
            </p>
            <p>A character with high Wisdom may be sensible, serene, "in tune," alert, or centered. A character with
              high Wisdom but low Intelligence may be aware, but simple. A character with high Wisdom but low Charisma
              knows enough to speak carefully and may become an advisor (or "power behind the throne") rather than a
              leader. The wise character lacking in both Intelligence and Charisma is uncouth and unsophisticated.
            </p>
            <p>A character with a low Wisdom score may be rash, imprudent, irresponsible, or "out of it."</p>
            <p>A character with high Charisma may be attractive, striking, personable, and confident. A character with
              high Charisma but low Intelligence can usually pass herself off as knowledgeable, until she meets a true
              expert. A charismatic character with low Wisdom may be popular, but she doesn't know who her real friends
              are. A charismatic character lacking in both Intelligence and Wisdom is likely to be shallow and unaware
              of others' feelings.
            </p>
            <p>A character with low Charisma may be reserved, gruff, rude, fawning, or simply nondescript.</p>
